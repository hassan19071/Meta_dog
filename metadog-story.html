        <p>Bill is one of our founders. His son had an open heart operation a few years ago. It was a very hard time for him and the family. The heartbreaking experience Bill went through sparked the idea to help other families who have ill children. That is how the venture of MetaaDog NFT started.</p>

He is pretty good-looking too!. Omar is the master of animation. He can vividly create almost any action. He is a very nice person to work with. Always very patient. The 3D animations have gone through numerous revisions. Nothing is trouble for Omar. We are so pleased to have him on the team. Yasir leads a part of our tech team. His leadership style is fair and assertive. His team works like a well-oiled engine, so smoothly all the time. Neil is “the” tech guy on our team. Nothing he can’t resolve. Even though he doesn’t know things at the beginning, he can always figure out how to do them eventually. He has an amazing ability to learn, which is very important in this fast-changing tech world. Bill is the mastermind of the team. Managing things at a high level. Bill always demands high quality, and to an extent sometimes people hard to cope with it. But we all know we want to create top-quality NFTs. Wendy is a very trusting investor. She has full confidence in the team and always provides support where she can. A motherly figure for the team behind the scene. The team is working hard to deliver the best NFT in the market. We strive to achieve what is laid out in our roadmap. MetaaDog goes to the moon!</p>

        <h3>Andy's Story</h3>
        <p>The founders of MetaaDog love dogs and they want to do something for children with serious illnesses. We invited over 70 artists to a contest for dog character design. The requirement was the dog image must be cute, pleasant to view. And it must be simple in design. There were over 150 submissions, which are all of very high quality. However, Andy’s design stands out. Andy is a very talented artist. His art is simple, vivid, and has a soul in it. Andy is a dog lover too. The MetaaDog is a humanized version of his labrador puppy. Below was Andy’s original art design. We believe this is the image that will be loved by children, families, and our community. Since then Andy has joined the MetaaDog team and has become an important member of this loving project.</p>

        <h3>What you did for helping families with sick children?</h3>
        <p>Metlab Technology Ltd, which is the operating vehicle for MetaaDog operates in New Zealand. We have been working with Ronald McDonald House (RMH NZ), an iconic organization for helping families with sick kids. Every year we participate in activities for RMH such as street appeal, annual Christmas party cooking for children there.</p>
        <p>For street appeal, we stand on the street to collect donations for RMH, which also increases the awareness of RMH. For the Christmas parties, we bring food and cook BBQ for the children who stay at RMH during Christmas. We really enjoyed what we did there. IT does make your heart harm when you are there.</p>

        <h3>What are the 3D animation actions?</h3>
        <p>It is still confidential before the full release of the 3D NFTs so we can pleasuantly surprise our members. However, you can see some sample 3D NFTs from our Twitter account, including skipping, playing football, golfing, etc. The total number of actions is 16. We will have a good number of actions/exercises with a variety of backgrounds and accessories, which will make our 3D NFT a truly valuable collection.</p>
